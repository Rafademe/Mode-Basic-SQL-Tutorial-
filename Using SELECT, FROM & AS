# There are two required ingredients in any SQL query: "SELECT" and "FROM" — and they have to be in that order.

# "SELECT" indicates which columns you’d like to view, and "FROM" identifies the table that they live in.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Ex 1

SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.us_housing_units
  
# This selects from any or all columns in the table "tutorial.us_housing_units"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Ex 2

# What’s happening in the query below?

SELECT year,
       month,
       west
  FROM tutorial.us_housing_units 

# In this case, the query is telling the database to return the "year", "month", and "west" columns from the table 
# "tutorial.us_housing_units". (Remember that when referencing tables in Mode's schema, the table names have to be
# preceded by the name of user who uploaded it.) 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Whenever you select multiple columns, they must be separated by commas, but you should *not* include a comma after
# the last column name.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# Practice Problem 1

# Write a query to select all of the columns in the tutorial.us_housing_units table without using *.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# My answer

SELECT year, 
       month, 
       month_name, 
       south,
       west,
       midwest,
       northeast
  FROM tutorial.us_housing_units 
  
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# By convention, keep the column names lower case and use underscores instead of spaces.

# However, if you’d like your results to look a bit more presentable, you can rename columns when you select them to
# include spaces.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Ex 3

If you want the "west" column to appear as "West Region" in the results, you would have to type:

SELECT west AS "West Region"
  FROM tutorial.us_housing_units
  
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# Practice Problem 2

# Write a query to select all of the columns in tutorial.us_housing_units and rename them so that their first 
# letters are capitalized. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# My answer

# 1. Find out the names of the columns

SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.us_housing_units
  
# This gives use the column names "year, month, month_name, south, west, midwest, & northeast"

# 2. Capitilize them!

SELECT year AS "Year", 
       month AS "Month", 
       month_name AS "Month Name", 
       south AS "South",
       west AS "West",
       midwest AS "Midwest",
       northeast AS "Northeast"
  FROM tutorial.us_housing_units
